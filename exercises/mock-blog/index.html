        <h3 class="post2">Alex Cameron's Forced Witness</h3>
        <p class="post1">
        Alex Cameron is an Australian musician, singer and songwriter from Sydney, Australia. He is best known for his solo career, a high-concept act in which Cameron adopts the persona of failed entertainer. He is also a member of the electronica act Seekae. During live performances, Cameron is often joined by saxophonist Roy Molloy.

        Cameron independently released his debut album, Jumping the Shark, for free on his website in 2013. After catching the attention of indie rock duo Foxygen at a concert in Paris, Cameron toured with Mac DeMarco, Kevin Morby and Unknown Mortal Orchestra. In 2016, Secretly Canadian reissued the album to a wider audience and growing cult fanbase.
        
        Alex Cameron has built his solo career on celebrating losers, telling stories of delusional deadbeats that are at once searingly funny and – thanks to his earnest, gravelly delivery and way with some affecting analog synthesisers – oddly poignant. On Forced Witness, the characters he inhabits are more pathetic than ever, from the “fucking lonely man” on “Candy May” (“I live with a deep regret/of what I do on the internet”) to the bloke who counts “the Down Syndrome Jew from the real estate crew” in his “pretty mean posse”. The more depraved Cameron gets, the more ecstatic the music, and it’s a hilarious device that sometimes obscures just how strong the songs are of their own accord, as when you’re doubling over at the “beautiful eyes/Nigerian guy” harmonising in catfish ballad “True Lies” – a fine pop song in any language. And it seems that the unlikely friendship that developed between Cameron and Brandon Flowers has rubbed off on both parties – see the Killers’ recent satirical single “The Man” and the chest-beating chorus on “Runnin’ Outta Luck”, featuring Flowers. “Business partner” Roy Molloy, whose presence until now has been largely limited to Cameron’s live shows, really comes into his own on this record, too, his abundant, jubilant sax serving to highlight the glorious wackiness of the whole exercise. A hoot. Listen to the single "Candy May" <a href="https://soundcloud.com/secretlycanadian/alex-cameron-candy-may">HERE</a></p>

      <h3 class="post2">Kirin J Callinan's Bravado</h3>
    <p class="post1">Album two sees Sydney’s enfant terrible parlaying more of his shit-stirring persona into his music. “Night on the piss, the shit hits the fan,” he deadpans in his laconic drawl on “My Moment”, a creeper that culminates in garish EDM sirens, while “S.A.D” is a balls-out electro-ballad... about drugs. This is Callinan’s dance record, filled with typically wry lyrics, amusing cameos – Jimmy Barnes lends his howl to “Big Enough” – and Callinan’s cool cronies (he counts Connan Mockasin, Weyes Blood and Jorge Elbrecht among his friends and fans). The power-ballad finale, though, is more self-aware than silly, as Callinan admits, “it was all bravado”. Listen to Kirin's Bravado

    <h3 class="post2">Benjamin Booker's Witness</h3>
    <p class="post1">Those among us who rebuke change are doomed to stagnancy, complacency, even failure. You see it in relationships all the time—when one person changes faster than the other, or one just doesn’t change at all. We all saw it in politics yesterday, when Donald J. Trump singlehandedly, shortsightedly decided to withdraw the United States from the environmental pact known as the Paris Accord. And in music, we tend to lambast the bands that stick with the same structural tendencies and lyrical templates for too long.

    Ironically, the most frequent criticism to New Orleans-based guitarist/songwriter Benjamin Booker’s new music is that it’s not what he did on his 2014 self-titled debut. They say he changed too quickly, too drastically. They miss the aimless rock ‘n’ roll. But after invoking Our Holy Spirit of Not Reading The Comments and just listening to Witness with open ears and hearts, Booker’s music emerges as defiant, insightful and both intimately and communally self-actualizing.

    For the most part, Booker leaves behind the punk-inspired blues rock of his first LP. Sequels to the snarling “Have You Seen My Son” and the quick-hitting “Violent Shiver” can be found bookending Witness on the opening “Right On You” and less-than-two-minute closing “All Was Well.” But for the most part, Booker trades the yelping for melodic musings, offering a soulful, fearless record that castigates racial and social injustices today.

    Frequently, Booker seems to search for a reason behind the racism he grew up with in Virginia and Florida. As a brief string introduction hits its vibrato-laden peak in “Believe,” he sings, “I just want to believe in something/I don’t care if it’s right or wrong/I just want to believe in something/How can I make it on my own?” That doubt returns in “Overtime,” as Booker wonders, “When did you become such a faithless man?”

    But the highpoint of Witness is its title track, in which Booker collaborates with gospel legend Mavis Staples (even dropping the f-bomb in front of her, which is actually a pretty punk-rock move). Each narrative verse returns to the pre-chorus, quote obviously about Trayvon Martin. Booker switches back from his rasping half-rapping to his singing voice and describes, “See we thought that we saw that he had a gun/Thought that it looked like he started to run.” Each time, the maternal Staples interjects, “Am I gonna be a witness?” That line especially serves as a rallying point for the whole album. It’s rhetorical, but also pragmatic—a reminder that our greatest chances for success happen when we have are when we grow and change together.Listen to Benjamin Booker's "Believe"
